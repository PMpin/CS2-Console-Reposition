# CS2-Console-Reposition
Every time you open the program it will replace your console coordinates with the correct ones.

"As of 2023-09-07, Valve hasn't yet fixed in the CS2 beta the console being outside of the visible real estate of my screen. Every time I close my game, I have to replace the values in the cfg, so I made this console program to replace it for me when I open it."
